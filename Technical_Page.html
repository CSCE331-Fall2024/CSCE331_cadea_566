    <p class="p Desc_Text">When it comes to previous projects, most of my experience stems from robotics and my college courses. I would argue that the one I found myself most invested are the robots I helped create during my history on a robotics team. During that time, I learned most of the skills I have been able to use today during college for my courses. Speaking of, my courses have had me take part in different projects. CSCE 312 had me make a Y86 Assembly processor simulation that needed to work with functions that Y86 assembly could process, the result of this picture can be seen to the left. On the other hand, CSCE 314 had me recreate the game Wordle in the Java programming language. While I have not necessarily completed many projects, I am not going to downplay them because each of them helped me grow my skills in different areas. If I had to choose, I would love to participate in research before I finished college, I would want to rise up to the challenge and hope further broaden my skills.</h1>
