    <p class="p Desc_Text">When it comes to community service and volunteer work, I would consider myself pretty generous with an estimated more than 300 hours of service. Whether it was enforced by my robotics team to do 20 or more hours of community service prior to a season or I chose to do some volunteer work myself. As previously mentioned, all members of my robotics team had to complete at least 20 hours of community service work to participate in each season. This has led to me taking part in some initiatives such as the PB&J Project where I got to work with the restaurant chain Which Wich to make PB&J sandwiches for those in need. Aside from big team initiatives like the PB&J Project, I also worked at my local food bank to continue filling my hours separately on my own time. Even in the time after finishing high school and my last season of robotics, my time volunteering did not stop there. While I was participating in the Texas A&M Engineering Academy through Dallas College, I took the opportunity of using the extra year I had to actually go back and participate in robotics one more time as a mentor of the team. During this time, I accumulated around 280 more community service hours as an alumni mentor, This gave me the chance to teach the rookies on the team about the process that was used to design, create, and code the robot and more. This also meant I got to help out at their competitions too, and because of a good season from the students, they had a chance to go to the FIRST Worlds Competition. If I had the opportunity in the future, I would love to go continue mentoring robotics teams, despite the large time investment I had a great time teaching the new students the intricacies of robotics.</h1>
