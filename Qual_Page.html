    <p class="p Desc_Text">When it comes to the many of the jobs computer science student go to after college, there are many skills that need to be learned and utilize to actually succeed in the workforce. While I donâ€™t have much professional experience, previous experiences has allowed me to gain expertise in many technical skills I will be able to use after college. If it were not for robotics, it would be unlikely that I actually learn multiple programming language aside from Java. Additionally, robotics taught how to work well with a team and how to collaborate. It was during my time in highschool my dad taught me how to approach and speak professionally, a skill I have used when applying for jobs and working with others. Despite the fact that I may not have the most impressive resume when it comes to my experience, I will say that I have an impressive skill set to back me up when I reach the workforce. If I had to choose a technical area to work in, I would have to choose robotics or software engineering. Both are very appealing to me in more ways than one and I generally enjoy doing both.</p>
